# Intent-to-Auditable-Trust-Object (IATO)

>This repository contains a formal semantic framework for reasoning about observational equivalence and refinement over parameterised SVE execution state under abstract virtualisation-mediated transitions.
The system models vector-length indexed execution state as a first-class semantic object and defines a labelled transition structure over architectural projections. The framework deliberately excludes hardware, hypervisor, scheduling, MMU, and implementation-specific execution mechanisms, treating execution infrastructure as an abstract correctness-preserving environment.
The repository is oriented toward:

- refinement semantics,
- bisimulation structure,
- vector-length indexed state reasoning,
- migration invariance,
- observational equivalence,
- and formally structured transition systems.

### Semantic Configuration Model
A configuration is defined as:

```text
C = (v, σ)

where:

v  ∈ V(λ)
σ  ∈ Σ
λ ∈ {128, 256, 512}
```
* v denotes vector-length indexed state
* σ denotes an abstract architectural projection
* Each vector length induces a distinct state space


**The framework does not model:**

* EL2 implementation,
* Stage-2 MMU behaviour,
* VMID allocation,
* scheduling,
* microarchitectural state,
* or hardware execution internals.

These are treated as abstract execution infrastructure external to the semantic system.



**Observational Semantics:**

Observation is defined through an observation function:
```text
O: C → O
```
**Observational equivalence is defined as:**

```text
C₁ ≈ C₂  ⇔  O(C₁) = O(C₂)
```

- Equivalence is defined only over observable architectural behaviour.
- The semantic system isolates vector-length indexed structure as the sole divergence dimension under transition and reconfiguration.



**Transition System:**

The framework defines a labelled transition system:
```text
C ─α→ C′

where:
α ∈ {exec, mig, reconf}
```
**Transition interpretation:**

* `exec` : execution transition within a fixed vector-length space
* `mig`  : abstract migration transformation
* `reconf`: vector-length reconfiguration transition

- Execution preserves vector length.
- Reconfiguration permits transition across vector-length indexed state spaces.



**Embedding Between Vector-Length Spaces:**

An embedding is defined between vector-length indexed state spaces:

```text
ι_λ₁→λ₂ : V(λ₁) → V(λ₂)

such that:

λ₁ ≤ λ₂

and:

O(ι(v)) = O(v)
```

The embedding acts as a structure-preserving injection across vector-length configurations.



**Refinement Relation:**

Refinement is defined as a forward simulation relation:
```
C₁ ⊑ C₂

iff for all transitions:

C₂ ─α→ C′₂
⇒
∃C′₁ :
C₁ ─α→ C′₁ ∧ C′₁ ≈ C′₂
```
The refinement relation establishes behavioural preservation under execution, migration, and reconfiguration transitions.



**Bisimulation:**

A relation R is a bisimulation if:
```
C₁ R C₂ ⇒ C₁ ≈ C₂
```
and transitions are matched in both directions.

The framework uses bisimulation to reason about observational equivalence preservation across parameterised execution configurations.



**Main Preservation Result:**

Migration preservation is expressed as:
```
C_H ⊑ C_G
⇒
O(mig(C_H)) = O(mig(C_G))
```
The proof structure is established through:

* embedding preservation,
* refinement stability,
* migration invariance,
* trace preservation,
* and transition commutativity.



**Core Semantic Properties:**

* `P₁`:  Each vector length induces a distinct indexed state space
* `P₂`:  Observational equivalence depends only on architectural projection σ
* `P₃`:  Embedding preserves observable behaviour
* `P₄`:  Refinement is stable under transition execution
* `P₅`:  Migration preserves observational semantics
* `P₆`:  Refinement is preserved over execution traces
* `P₇`:  Transition application commutes with vector-state embedding

### Scope: 

This repository defines a semantic and relational formalisation framework for reasoning about computation at an abstract level.

It focuses on the mathematical structure of systems rather than their execution in concrete runtime environments.

### Non-Goals:

This framework is *not*:

- a hardware implementation
- a hypervisor implementation
- a kernel engineering project
- a QEMU/KVM deployment or configuration repository
- a microarchitectural execution model
- a systems-level emulator or simulator


The system models *abstract execution semantics* over parameterised state representations, with emphasis on:

- semantic preservation properties
- relational reasoning over state transformations
- equivalence notions under structural variation
- compositional behaviour of transitions

The formal objects in this repository are interpreted as:

- parameterised execution states (including vector-length indexed configurations)
- abstract transition systems capturing execution, migration, and reconfiguration
- relational mappings between semantic domains
- observational projections of system behaviour

### Core Objective:

The central pillar is to reason about:

*Preservation of semantic structure under transformation of execution state in a virtualisation-structured operational model.*

This includes studying:

- when two systems are observationally equivalent
- when transformations preserve behavioural semantics
- how refinement and bisimulation relations are maintained under migration-like dynamics
